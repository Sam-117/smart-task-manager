# Smart Task Manager

## Project Overview

**Smart Task Manager** is an intelligent productivity application designed to help individuals and teams efficiently organize, prioritize, and track their tasks. The app leverages AI to automate routine planning, provide smart suggestions, and streamline workflow management. It is ideal for students, professionals, and organizations seeking to boost productivity and reduce manual overhead in task management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (with TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- **AI Tools:** OpenAI API, GitHub Copilot

## AI Integration Strategy

AI will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle and within the application itself:

- **Code Generation**
  - Use AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to scaffold React components, backend routes, and utility functions.
  - Accelerate boilerplate code creation and enforce best practices.

- **Testing Support**
  - Generate unit and integration tests for frontend and backend modules using AI-assisted suggestions.
  - Improve test coverage and reliability with context-aware test case generation.

- **Documentation**
  - Employ AI to generate and maintain docstrings, inline comments, and keep the README up to date.
  - Ensure clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation across the codebase.

- **Context-Aware Techniques**
  - Feed API specifications, file tree structures, and code diffs into AI tools to generate relevant code, tests, and documentation.
  - Use AI to analyze project context and provide tailored development suggestions.
